# Python for Everybody Solution Manual
## my solutions to Python for Everybody by Dr. Charles R. Severance
To use this repository locally first open a terminal window and change your
directory in which you want to have the whole repo, and then run the following
commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DrNakiz/py4e-solutions.git
$ cd py4e-solutions
```
This repository contains an IPython notebook(Python for Everybody Solutions.ipynb)
in which you can find the answers to exercises. Some files are needed in order
to run the cells in IPython notebook and they have to be in the same directory
as the IPyton notebook. These files can be found in the code3 directory along
with some other useful source codes and libraries, but I have already copied
the prerequisite files in the same location as the notebook to make it easier
for you to follow along. But you are also welcome to go ahead and use the other
files which are provided by the main author himself.  
Also I want to mention that my goal is not spoiling the exercises, but only
to provide a chance for anybody reading the book to also check their solutions
here, and maybe get another insight or even find a problem with the solutions
provided here and mention it so we can all help each other learn the book
better.
